<strong>Having an MSc or Final Year Project supervised by us</strong>
<br />
If you study at UCL (Computer Science) and you are interested to do a final year or an MSc project with us please check <a href="/publications">our publications</a>, <a href="/join-us">calls for PhD students and postdocs</a> (that may also cover some topics of interest), and <a href="/assets/pdf/teaching/ML-MSc-projects.pdf">this annually updated document</a>. If you find a topic of interest within these links or your topic of interest is related, please get in touch via an email (<a href= "mailto: v.lampos@ucl.ac.uk">v.lampos@ucl.ac.uk</a>). Please include your CV, topic of interest, and a brief statement to justify your motivation and fit. As projects are allocated in a first-come-first-serve basis and the places are limited (normally up to 2 final year projects and up to 4 MSc projects), please reach out to us as early as possible.
