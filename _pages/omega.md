<h3>Why are we called the Ω research group?</h3>

<p>
  <strong>Omega</strong> (<strong>Ω</strong> and in Greek “Ωμέγα”) is the uppercase form of the last letter of the modern Greek alphabet (lowercase “ω”). Its name literally means “great/large O”, contrasting with Omicron (Ο, ο), which means “small O”. Thus, omega is essentially a composite word formed from “Ω” (ō) and “μέγα” (mega, “great”).
</p>

<p>
  Because Ω is the final letter of the Greek alphabet, omega is often used symbolically to denote the end, the last, or the ultimate limit, in contrast with alpha (Α, α), the first letter, which symbolises the beginning. This duality—“alpha and omega”—is famously used to signify the entirety of something, from beginning to end.

  As the field of AI discovers new limits in a rapid fashion, its Ω seems to be constantly redefined too. Inevitably, for us, Ω represents both an aspiration and a challenge: the pursuit of ultimate questions, the exploration of boundaries, and the effort to reach the furthest horizons of what intelligence can achieve. Far from denoting a final endpoint, our Ω is a reminder that every “end” in knowledge opens into a new beginning, and that true discovery is an endless cycle of redefining the possible.
