<h3>PhD studentships</h3> (to begin in October 2026 or any date thereafter, duration: 4 years)

<p>
  If you are interested in a PhD topic in either health and machine learning (any topic we can find data for), time series forecasting or natural language processing, please get in touch. Please have a look at our <a href="/publications">current publications</a> and do not hesitate to reach out via email (<tt style="font-size:0.90em; font-weight:bold">v.lampos@ucl.ac.uk</tt>) for more information. If you are successful in your application, you will be based at the <a href="https://www.ucl.ac.uk/ai-centre/">Centre for Artificial Intelligence</a> (AI) in the <a href="https://www.ucl.ac.uk/computer-science/">Department of Computer Science</a> at <a href="https://www.ucl.ac.uk/">University College London</a> (UCL). UCL is one of the top universities in the world and its AI centre one of the best places for this kind of research training in the UK.  
</p>


<p>
  Prior to applying formally, please send an email with:
  <ul>
    <li>a CV (2 pages max), and</li>
    <li><strong>optionally</strong> a research statement (6 pages max, excluding references) with a lay summary (abstract) of your proposed research, a background review of related work in this area, the core research proposal and how it fits within the current and past research landscape, and a description of what you would like to achieve (and how) in the first 6-12 months of your PhD. Please use <a href="https://www.overleaf.com/read/cdjjmtmyhdcg">this LaTeX template</a> for your research statement.</li>
  </ul>
</p>

<p>
  Please note that although you can definitely contact me without sending a proposal in the first instance, the development of a proposal will be an essential and very crucial part of your application process.
</p>

<p>
  It will be beneficial to begin this process as early as possible in the academic year, e.g. October of year <tt style="font-size:0.95em">x-1</tt>, if you want to start a PhD in September of year <tt style="font-size:0.95em">x</tt>. Detailed instructions for formally applying are available <a href="https://www.ucl.ac.uk/computer-science/study/postgraduate-research/computer-science-mphilphd">here</a> (general PhD in Computer Science call) and <a href="https://www.ucl.ac.uk/scholarships/research-excellence-scholarship">here</a> (UCL research excellence scholarship, <strong>deadline:</strong> January 2025, positions are competitive, but fully funded). Please note that applications unless otherwise stated are formally being reviewed twice in the academic year with <strong>soft submission deadlines</strong> in mid-January and mid-April, and that all PhD candidates will need to go through an interview process. For exceptional cases we might be able to expedite the process outside of these predetermined dates.
